title: Shrimp Pasta With Tomato Sauce
---

* One 28 oz can of whole tomatoes (preferably san marzano)
* 1/3 cup olive oil
* 1/2 medium fennel bulb, fronds reserved, core removed, buld thinly sliced.
* 8 cloves of garlic smashed or grated
* 1 fresno chile (optional) very thinly sliced 
* 1/4 cup of white wine (red is fine in a pinch)
* 12 oz pasta (any short kind will do)
* 1lb shrimp (small kind)
* 2 Tbl butter

Set a fine mesh over a medium bowl. Working over sieve, squeeze tomatoes to release juices and break up flesh. Let tomatoes drain in sieve, collecting juices in bowl until ready to use.

Heat oil in large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium. Cook fennel garlice and chile (if using), stirring often until garlic is golden around edges, 5-8 minutes. Transfer fennel mixture with a slotted spoon to a small bowl.

Increase heat to high, cook drained tomatoes in the same pot, stirring occasionally until broken down and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add wine, scraping up browned bits and cook until almost completely evaporated, about 1 minute. Add fennel mixture and collected tomato juices, bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally until slightly thickened, 5-10 minutes.

Meanwhile cook pasta until al Dante. Drain and mix pasta into the tomato sauce.  Add shrimp and cook for 3 minutes. Thin sauce with pasta liquid if needed. Toss in a little butter. Divide into dishes and serve with sprinkling of finely diced fennel fronds.
