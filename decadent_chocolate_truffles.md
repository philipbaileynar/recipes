# Decadent Chocolate Truffles

by Carolyn Lim Chua

prep time 10 minutes, cook time 1 minutes, stand 5 minutes, refrigerate 1 hour 25 min. Makes 20 truffles.

# Ingredient

- 8 oz (225g) semi-sweet chocolate
- ½ cup (125 ml) whipping cream
- 2 Tbsp (30 ml) unsalted butter
- 1 Tbsp (15 ml) corn syrup
- 1 tsp (5 ml) vanilla
- 2 Tbsp (30 ml) sifted unsweetened cocoa powder

# Directions

1. Finely chop chocolate.
2. Combine cream, butter and corn syrup in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Turn off heat. Add chocolate and vanilla. Using a wooden spoon, gently stir until smooth. Pour into medium bowl. To cool and thicken, refrigerate for 1 hour, stirring every 20 min. Then check if mixture is firm enough to roll into a ball, yet still scoopable. When ready, scoop up about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of chocolate mixture. Roll quickly between your hand to form a ball about 1 inch across. It doesn’t need to be perfect. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chocolate mixture. Refrigerate, uncovered, until firm, at least 20 min.
3. Place cocoa in a small bowl. If balls are not as round as you’d like, roll again. Roll one at a time in coca powder to lightly cover. Return to baking sheet. Refrigerate to firm up again at least 5 min. Store in layers, separated by waxed paper, in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
