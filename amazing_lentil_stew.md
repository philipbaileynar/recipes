# Amazing Lentil Stew

The coconut milk gives this dish a smooth and sweet flavor, and the green curry paste and lime leaves gives it character.

Serves 5-6 people.

# Ingredients

- ½ head of cauliflower
- 1 small yellow onion
- ½ zucchini
- 3-4 Tbsp oil
- 3 lime leaves
- 1 tsp green curry paste
- 400 ml crushed tomatoes
- 400 ml coconut milk
- 200 ml red lentils
- 200 ml water
- 1 tsp salt

# Directions

1. Peel and chop the onion.
2. Rinse and take the cauliflower apart, into little bunches.
3. Rinse and slice the zucchini.
4. Mix the curry paste with a little warm oil, then sauté the vegetables and lime leaves with the oil and curry paste. Cover the pan and let the ingredients soften slightly.
5. Add crushed tomatoes, coconut milk, red lentils and water. Let it simmer for a long time – the longer you leave it, the more the flavors will come out! The stew should simmer for at least 20 minutes. Add salt to taste.
6. Serve with arugula salad and flat bread.
