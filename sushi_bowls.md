This is out go-to quick and easy weeknight dinner option. It's basically your choice of chopped ingredients on a bed of rice. A couple of twists give this a Japanese flair (rice vinegar mixed into the rice and seaweed garnish). We love the smoked tofu but you could use plain or omit altogether.

* Diced red bell pepper
* Diced cucumber
* Edamame
* Havled cherry tomatoes
* Fried egg (optional)
* Shrimp (optional)
* [Smoked tofu](https://i5.walmartimages.ca/images/Large/000/981/999999-57864000981.jpg)
* Dried seaweed cut into thin strips
* Siracha and mayonaese mix (see below)
* 1 cup of basmarti or plain rice
* 1/4 cup rice vinegar

Cook the rice as you would normally and while it's cooking prepare your choice of toppings from those listed above. Once the rice is cooked mix in the rice vinegar before serving the rice onto wide flat bowls or plates. The rice can be warm or cold whichever is your preference.

Sprinkle the prepared toppings over each portion topping with the seaweed strips. Finally if you want some spice then mix 2 parts  mayonaese with one part siracha and drizzle this mix over top.
