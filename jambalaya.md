# Jambalaya

This recipe is originally from the [Southern Accent](http://southernaccent.com/) restaurant in Toronto. I’ve been cooking it for 12 years or so. It’s a commitment because of the first step… but the result is well worth it.

I’ve also adapted this recipe to make a fish version. Simply replace all the meat ingredients with chunks of blackened cod, salmon or other strong flavoured fish. I add the fish at the same time as the shrimp – just before placing the dish in the oven. Try to avoid stirring too much and breaking up the fish.
