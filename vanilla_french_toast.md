# Vanilla Cinnamon Baked French Toast

# Ingredients

- 1 vanilla bean
- 2 cups (500 ml) milk
- 8 slices egg bread, each ¾ inch thick
- butter
- 6 eggs
- ¼ cup granulated sugar
- ¾ tsp ground cinnamon
- ½ cup maple syrup
- Fresh berries or sliced fruit

# Directions

1. Cut vanilla beam in half lengthwise. Scrape sees from pod with the blunt edge of a knife and add to milk along with vanilla pod. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or for up to 1 day.
2. Cut each slice of bread into quarters on a diagonal to make triangles. Arrange, points-up, in a buttered 9×13 inch (3 litre) glass baking dish, in three rows lengthwise, overlapping as necessary.
3. Remove vanilla pod from milk, squeezing to extract the flavour; discard pod. Whisk together eggs, sugar, and ½ tsp of the cinnamon until blended, then whisk in milk. Pour over bread in dish and press gently to immerse. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours for up to 24 hrs.
4. To server, preheat oven to 350º F (180º C).
5. Uncover baking dish and press bread gently with a spatula to immerse in liquid. Bake for about 30 minutes or until puffed, golden brown and a knife inserted in the centre comes out clean.
6. Meanwhile, whisk together maple syrup and remaining cinnamon in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat until bubbling. Server with hot syrup and berries.
