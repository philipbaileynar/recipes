# Best Banana Bread

I have been making this banana bread for years. It is foolproof, very delicious, and reasonably healthy. And it is super easy! Everything goes in one bowl and you can whip it up in under 10 minutes. I can’t be bothered to take a photo of the loaf I baked this morning. Yes, having a newborn makes you that tired. All my dear readers, you know what banana bread looks like, right?

Add all the following ingredients in one bowl:

½ cup applesauce  (try to get unsweetened; if using sweetened, reduce the amount of sugar added)
1/2-1 cup demerera sugar (or half and half white and demerara)
1½ cups flour (I can use 1 cup all-purpose, ½ whole wheat)
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
3 ripe bananas (or two really big ones)

That’s it! Mix it all up and bake in a greased loaf pan for an hour at 325. If you want a dessert bread (which of course, you do), add about 1/3-1/2 a bag of chocolate chips.
