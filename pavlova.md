[![Pavlova](http://recipes.blueoyster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Pavlova-300x217.jpg)](http://recipes.blueoyster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Pavlova.jpg)The national dish of New Zealand, this recipe originates from Philip’s Nana and is a traditional favourite in the Bailey household.

# Ingredients

- 3 egg whites
- 198g caster sugar (7oz)
- 1 teaspoon corn flour
- 1 teaspoon malt vinegar (“white” also works)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla essence

# Directions

Turn oven on to 275° F (140° C, gas mark 1).

Whisk the egg whites until stiff in a clean bowl. Gradually add half the sugar a table spoon at a time, whisking all the time. blend the corn flour, vinegar and essence together and add to mixture and continue to whisk in the remaining sugar gradually.

Prepare a baking sheet by wetting the tray, then use greaseproof paper or baking parchment to cover tray pressing into the dampness, finally spread a teaspoon of olive oil over the centre of the paper. Spread the egg white mixture on to the centre of the tray, do not try to spread it too thinly. around a 9-10 inch circle and at least 1 inch high.

Place in centre of the oven for 1 hour (it needs to be up to temperature before you put Pavlova in) cook for 1 hour. Turn the oven off but DO NOT OPEN DOOR. leave to cool in the oven.

During cooking time cut the grapes in half, if they have pips depip them and soak in a mixture of the sherry and sugar. To serve strain the grape juice into the cream and whisk the cream mixture until as stiff as you can get it. Gently spread the cream on top of the Pavlova and arrange the grapes on top.

Put on at least 1lb, but enjoy!
