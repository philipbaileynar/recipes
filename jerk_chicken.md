# Jerk Chicken

This method of cooking pork and chicken dates back to the Carib-Arawak Indians who inhabited Jamaica. After capturing an animal and thoroughly cleaning and gutting it, the Indians placed it in a deep pit lined with stones and covered with green wood, which, when burned, would smoke heavily and add to the flavor. But first, the carcass was “jerked” with a sharp object to make holes, which were stuffed with a variety of spices. The holes also allowed heat to escape without loss of moisture.

The results were superb. The meat was not only wonderfully spiced, but moist and tender.” (Note: Sugar Reef is a restaurant in Manhattan).

Note: Scotch Bonnet peppers, also known as “Habaneros” are the hottest of the capsicum peppers, they’re truly incendiary. Substitute Serranos of Thai Bird chilies if you can’t find them.
