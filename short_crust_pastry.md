# Short Crust Pastry

This pastry is used for my Mumâ€™s amazing mince pies.

# Ingredients

(Makes 8 pies)

6oz Plain Flour
3oz Margarine (could use butter but very rich)
A pinch of salt
50 ml water
Egg, beaten

# Description

Add the flour, margarine and salt to the blender and buzz for 5-10 seconds until evenly mixed.
Add the water to the blender and buzz until the pastry becomes one large ball.
Roll out the pastry until 2 mm thick.
Grease the pie tray
Cut and line the pie tray with the pastry.
Put one desert spoon of mincemeat in each pie.
Put on the lid and push down.
Pierce each lid with a fork or knife.
Brush the lid of each pie with a little beaten egg.
Bake the pies for 20-25 minutes on the top shelf at 400F, until golden brown.
