# Vegetarian Meatballs

2 cups cooked wild rice
1 heaping cup finely chopped mushrooms
1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
2 eggs
3/4 cup breadcrumbs
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
olive oil (optional)

# For the Gravy

3 tablespoons salted butter
1/2 teaspoon onion powder and/or garlic powder
3 tablespoons flour
1 1/2 cups vegetable broth
1/2 cup sour cream
salt and black pepper to taste

# Method

Meatballs: Preheat the oven to 425. Mix the meatball ingredients together. Roll into balls (1-2 tablespoons each) and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until firm when you press them.

Gravy: Melt butter in a large skillet. Add onion powder, garlic powder, and flour. Let it bubble for a few minutes to remove any floury taste. Slowly add broth, whisking after each addition, to make a smooth sauce. Stir in sour cream. Adjust consistency to taste with more broth. Season to taste.
Thatâ€™s all! Place your cooked meatballs in the gravy and get them all nice and saucy. Serve with potatoes, salad, or roasted veggies.
